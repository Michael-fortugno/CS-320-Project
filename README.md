# CS-320-Project
Contact services project
I ensure my code is functional and secure by running my code and testing it to ensure the code runs correctly.
I also write test cases for how the code is exected to be used and ensure all my test cases are being run.
I need to look at the coverage of my code to ensure that all blocks of code are being run as expected.
I interpet needs by getting requirments for the program from the client.
I ensurse we communicate and I ask follow up questions about what they expect.
I will again go over the requirenments with the client from how I interpeted their answers
and if any corrections are needed we will get them corrected then.
I will make sure we are on the same page of what they expect of the program before any development begins
As development begins any parts that require approval will get approved by the client beore we proceed.
Constant communication and follow up will ensure we are building what is expected.
As we build the product I ensure we build what the client wants by following all the requirnments
exact and to those specification and how it was explained through the communications
We will build test cases to those exact requirnments and ensure all expectations
are accoounted for in the testing and any errors will be worked through before we
move on to other parts of the project.
We will not cut corners to save time and we will use industry standard procedures and practices
to ensure the client gets what they expected with minumal rework required in the future.
